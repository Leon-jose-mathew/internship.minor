            The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's chief consort, Empress Bega Begum,

            Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her.

            The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India 
            that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan 
            commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided 
            to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design 
            is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. 
            The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and 
            combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
